- `triz_principles` - 40 inventive principles
- `triz_documents` - 65 books, chunked and embedded
- `materials_database` - Engineering materials
- `triz_contradictions` - Historical contradiction resolutions

### Stage 3: Contradiction Deep Dive
- Pattern-based extraction
- Discovery from books
- Source tracking for each contradiction

### Stage 4: Semantic Principle Discovery
**Not just matrix lookup!**
- Vector search through principles
- Semantic matching to problem
- Extraction from book mentions
- Multi-source scoring

### Stage 5: Cross-Domain Analogy Search
- Identifies problem domain
- Searches other domains (nature, automotive, aerospace, medical)
- Finds analogous solutions
- Transfers approaches across domains

### Stage 6: Gap Detection
Identifies missing information:
- Material specifications
- Implementation guidance
- Case studies
- Validation data

### Stage 7: Recursive Deep Dive
If gaps detected:
- Generates follow-up queries
- Searches again (up to 3 levels)
- Fills knowledge gaps

### Stage 8: Research Synthesis
- Combines findings from all sources
- Generates 5-7 deeply researched solutions
- Each with:
  - Research citations (5-10 sources)
  - Cross-domain insights
  - Implementation hints from books

docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
```

### Ollama Issues
```bash
# Check service
ollama list

# Pull model if missing
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### Books Not Ingested
```bash
# Check collection
python -c "
from src.triz_tools.services.vector_service import get_vector_service
vs = get_vector_service()
info = vs.get_collection_info('triz_documents')
print(f'Vectors in collection: {info[\"points_count\"] if info else 0}')
"

# Re-ingest if empty
python scripts/ingest-books-intelligent.py
```

### Slow Performance
```bash
# Reduce findings per query in research_agent.py
findings_per_query=3  # Instead of 5

# Or reduce total queries
