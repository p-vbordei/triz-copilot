## 🚀 Working Features

### 1. Command Line Interface
```bash
# Solve a problem
python3 src/cli.py solve "Reduce weight while maintaining strength"

# Get principle details
python3 src/cli.py tool principle 1

# Query contradiction matrix
python3 src/cli.py tool matrix 1 14

# Interactive mode
python3 src/cli.py interactive
```

### 2. Three Interaction Modes
- **Guided Workflow** (`/triz-workflow`): Step-by-step TRIZ methodology

- **Direct Tools** (`/triz-tool`): Expert access to TRIZ components

### 3. Advanced Services
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant integration with file-based fallback
- **Embeddings**: Ollama with nomic-embed-text model
- **Session Management**: JSON persistence with workflow tracking
- **Materials Database**: Engineering materials recommendations
- **Analysis Engine**: Complete TRIZ analysis pipeline

### 4. Knowledge Base
- 40 TRIZ inventive principles
- 39x39 contradiction matrix
- Materials database
- PDF ingestion capability
- Semantic search ready

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ All contract tests pass (20/20)
2. ✅ Performance requirements met (<2s queries, <10s solve)
3. ✅ TRIZ Co-Pilot works standalone and with Gemini CLI
4. ✅ Offline capability with file-based fallbacks
5. ✅ TDD methodology followed (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

## 📖 Books Ready for Ingestion

The system can now ingest your TRIZ and materials books:

```bash
# Ingest TRIZ books
python3 src/triz_tools/setup/knowledge_ingestion.py \
  --directory "/Users/vladbordei/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-bordeivlad@gmail.com/My Drive/Books/Product Discovery and Vision/"

# Ingest materials books
python3 src/triz_tools/setup/knowledge_ingestion.py \
  --directory "/Users/vladbordei/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-bordeivlad@gmail.com/My Drive/Books/materials books/"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Test the system:**
```bash
cd /Users/vladbordei/Documents/Development/triz2
PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/cli.py solve "Your problem here"
```

2. **Run the demo:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 examples/demo.py
```

3. **Start interactive mode:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/cli.py interactive
```

## 💡 Example Usage

```bash
# Aerospace problem
python3 src/cli.py solve "Design lightweight but strong aircraft components"

# Manufacturing optimization
python3 src/cli.py solve "Increase production speed while reducing defects"
