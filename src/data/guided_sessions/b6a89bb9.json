  "problem": "I need a material for robotic structural components (8cm x 2cm sheets) that combines contradictory properties:\n\nCURRENT SITUATION:\n- Robot: Household following robot with telescopic camera stick\n- Component location: Circuit/motor assembly area (high heat from motors)\n- Current materials considered:\n  * Aluminum: bendable for 90\u00b0 angles but too heavy\n  * CFRP (Carbon Fiber): very light (~60% of aluminum) but NOT bendable/formable\n  * Magnesium: light but fire risk near hot motors\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Must be bendable/formable to create 90\u00b0 angles without additional parts\n2. Must be as light as CFRP (or close)\n3. Must resist heat from motors\n4. Should minimize assembly complexity (fewer screws/parts)\n5. Sheet thickness around 2mm total\n\nCONTRADICTION:\n- Improving: Weight (need lighter material)\n- Worsening: Formability/bendability (need to bend for angles)\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Cannot use molding with CFRP (it's a rigid composite plastic)\n- Magnesium too dangerous near hot motors\n- Need to keep total robot weight down\n- Multiple components need 90\u00b0 connections\n\nPARTIAL SOLUTION CONSIDERED:\n- Aluminum sandwich: 0.5mm Al sheets + 1mm polymer foam core (cross-linked polyethylene) = 2mm total\n- Uncertain if better than current CFRP solution\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\nMaterial that is bendable, lightweight (close to CFRP density), heat resistant, and allows simple assembly with formed angles.",
