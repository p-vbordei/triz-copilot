### Overall Progress: 63/63 tasks (100%) ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-triz-engineering-co/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies
- **Setup before everything**: T001-T006 → all other tasks
- **Tests before implementation**: T007-T021 → T022-T054
- **Models before services**: T022-T027 → T028-T032
- **Core library before tools**: T033-T036 → T037-T040
- **Tools before integration**: T037-T040 → T041-T045
- **Data setup before validation**: T046-T050 → T062

### Sequential Dependencies (Same Files)
- T007-T009: Same test file (workflow contract tests)
- T043-T045: TOML configuration sequence
- T037-T040: Tool implementation sequence

```

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - contracts/triz_tools.py → T007-T013 (contract tests)
   - contracts/gemini_mcp_schema.json → T041-T042 (MCP implementation)
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - 7 entities → T022-T027 (model creation tasks)
   - Vector embeddings → T029, T036, T050 (embedding tasks)
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Workflow mode → T014, T018 (integration tests)
   - Autonomous solve → T015, T019 (integration tests)
   - Direct tools → T016, T017 (integration tests)

4. **From Research Decisions**:
   - Qdrant setup → T004, T015, T046 (database tasks)
   - Ollama integration → T005, T016, T029 (embedding tasks)
   - Session management → T017, T024, T030, T035 (state tasks)

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T007-T013)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T022-T027)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T007-T021 → T022+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Performance requirements tested (T020-T021)
- [x] Integration scenarios covered (T014-T019)
- [x] Quickstart validation included (T062)

## Success Criteria
Tasks are complete when:
1. All contract tests pass (implementing T007-T013)
2. All integration tests pass (T014-T019)
3. Performance tests pass <2s tool queries, <10s autonomous solve (T020-T021)
4. Quickstart guide validates successfully (T062)
5. TRIZ Co-Pilot works seamlessly within Gemini CLI environment

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (RED-GREEN-Refactor)
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow constitutional principles: Library-first, Test-first, Local-first
- Maintain structured logging throughout implementation
- Use real Qdrant container, not mocks, for integration tests
