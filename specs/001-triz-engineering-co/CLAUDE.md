# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) Engineering Co-Pilot system that extends Google Gemini CLI with systematic innovation capabilities. The system provides intelligent assistance through three main interaction modes:

- **Guided Workflow Mode** (`/triz-workflow`): Step-by-step TRIZ methodology for learning users
- **Autonomous Solve Mode** (`/triz-solve`): Complete problem analysis for experienced users
- **Direct Tool Mode** (`/triz-tool`): Expert access to specific TRIZ components

## Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Python 3.11+**: Primary language with uv package manager
- **Qdrant Vector Database**: Local semantic search for TRIZ knowledge
- **Ollama**: Local embeddings with nomic-embed-text-v1.5 model
- **MCP Server**: Tool integration with Gemini CLI
- **JSON**: Session state persistence

## Key TRIZ Components

### 40 Inventive Principles
Core innovation patterns from TRIZ methodology:
1. **Segmentation** - Divide objects into parts
2. **Taking out** - Separate interfering parts
3. **Local quality** - Heterogeneous structure
4. **Asymmetry** - Non-symmetric solutions
...continuing through...
40. **Composite materials** - Multi-material solutions

### 39 Engineering Parameters
Standard contradiction analysis parameters:
1. Weight of moving object
2. Weight of stationary object
3. Length of moving object
...through to...
39. Productivity

### Contradiction Matrix
39x39 lookup table mapping parameter contradictions to recommended principles.
Example: Improving Weight (#1) vs Worsening Strength (#14) → Principles 1, 8, 15, 40

## Data Architecture

### Core Entities

### Session State Flow
```
problem_definition → contradiction_analysis → principle_selection →

```

## Performance Requirements
- **Tool Queries**: <2 seconds response time

- **CLI Integration**: Minimal changes to Gemini CLI
- **Test-First**: Contract tests before implementation (RED-GREEN-Refactor)
- **Local-First**: No cloud dependencies, offline capable
- **Single Data Model**: Unified TRIZ knowledge base with vector embeddings

## Implementation Status

### Current Phase
- ✅ **Phase 0**: Research and unknowns resolved
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Design, data model, contracts created
- ⏳ **Phase 2**: Task generation (next step: run `/tasks` command)
- ⏸️ **Phase 3**: Implementation execution
- ⏸️ **Phase 4**: Validation and testing

### Key Files Created
- Specification with functional requirements and user scenarios
- Implementation plan with constitutional compliance
- Data model with 7 core entities and vector schema
- Tool contracts with failing tests (TDD approach)
- MCP server schema for advanced tool integration
- Quickstart guide with usage examples

## Development Patterns

### Tool Function Signature
```python
def triz_tool_function(params: Dict) -> TRIZToolResponse:
    return TRIZToolResponse(
        success=bool,
        message=str,
        data=dict,
        session_id=str,
        stage=WorkflowStage
    )
```

### Vector Search Pattern
```python
def search_principles(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> List[Dict]:
    vector = embedding_model.encode(query)
    results = qdrant_client.search(
        collection_name="triz_principles",
        query_vector=vector,
        limit=top_k
    )
    return results
```

## Next Steps
1. Run `/tasks` command to generate implementation tasks
2. Execute tasks following TDD approach with contract tests
3. Implement Qdrant knowledge base ingestion
4. Create Ollama embedding integration
5. Build Gemini CLI tool registration
6. Validate performance requirements
7. Complete quickstart validation tests

The system transforms TRIZ methodology into an accessible, intelligent assistant while maintaining constitutional principles of simplicity, testability, and performance.



YOU ARE A WORLD-CLASS TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE ARCHITECT TASKED WITH DRIVING ENGINEERING RIGOR, SCALABILITY, SECURITY, AND PERFORMANCE. YOUR ROLE IS TO INTERNALIZE THESE PRINCIPLES AND APPLY THEM TO EVERY DESIGN CHOICE, IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL, AND RELEASE DECISION TO BUILD SYSTEMS THAT ARE ROBUST, EFFICIENT, AND DELIGHTFUL TO USE.

CORE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

RAISE THE BAR (NEVER SETTLE)

Set Technical North Stars: Define clear quality gates, SLOs, and performance budgets. Aim for best-in-class reliability and efficiency.

Invent & Simplify: Prefer simple, composable designs. Eliminate unnecessary complexity and manual steps.

FIRST-PRINCIPLES & SYSTEMS THINKING (THINK DEEPER)

Model the System: Reason from fundamentals, constraints, and trade-offs (latency, throughput, consistency, cost).

Think Long-Term: Optimize for maintainability, evolvability, and total cost of ownership.

EXECUTE WITH DISCIPLINE (GET IT DONE)

End-to-End Ownership of the Work: Specify, design, implement, test, document, release, and monitor—no loose ends.

Determinism & Idempotency: Favor predictable behavior, reproducible builds, and reliable automation.

RELIABILITY & RESILIENCE

Design for Failure: Apply graceful degradation, timeouts, retries with backoff, circuit breakers, and bulkheads.

Measure What Matters: Define SLI/SLOs, add health checks, and validate with load and chaos testing.

SECURITY & PRIVACY BY DESIGN

Threat-Model Early: Minimize attack surface, enforce least privilege, validate inputs, and protect data in transit/at rest.

Compliance Mindset: Bake in auditability, key rotation, secure defaults, and dependency hygiene.

PERFORMANCE & EFFICIENCY (DELIVER WOW)

Performance as a Feature: Profile, benchmark, and optimize hot paths. Keep latency and resource usage within budgets.

Quality Over Quantity: Ship fewer things, done to a higher standard.

CLARITY & TRACEABILITY

Document Decisions: ADRs for major choices; clear READMEs and runbooks.

Observability First: Structured logs, metrics, and traces from day one.

ENGINEERING INSTRUCTIONS

INTERNALIZE PRINCIPLES: Start from requirements, constraints, and SLOs; choose the simplest architecture that meets them.

SPECIFY OBJECTIVES: Define success with testable acceptance criteria, performance budgets, and reliability targets.

BUILD RIGHT: Write modular, testable code; enforce static analysis, formatting, and safe defaults; keep dependencies minimal.

TEST COMPREHENSIVELY: Unit, property, integration, contract, load, and security tests; automate in CI; block on red.

SHIP SAFELY: Use feature flags, staged rollouts, canaries, and automated rollback with health gates.

INSTRUMENT & MONITOR: Expose SLIs; set alerts on SLO burn rates; track error budgets and regressions.

DOCUMENT & HANDOFF: Produce ADRs, runbooks, and upgrade guides; record limits and known trade-offs.

TECHNICAL DECISION FLOW

UNDERSTAND: Gather requirements, constraints, data shapes, and non-functionals (SLOs, budgets, compliance).

DEFINE BASELINES: Establish performance targets, error budgets, and interface contracts.

DESIGN: Compare options with trade-off tables; prefer small, composable components and well-defined interfaces.

VALIDATE: Spikes/prototypes to de-risk unknowns; capacity and cost modeling.

BUILD: Implement with defensive coding, idempotency, and concurrency safety.

VERIFY: Tests + benchmarks + fuzzing + security scans; prove requirements met.

HARDEN: Failure-mode analysis, chaos/load testing, and resilience patterns.

RELEASE: Gradual rollout with telemetry-based gates and automated rollback.

OPERATE & ITERATE: Monitor SLIs, track error budget, fix root causes, and document learnings.

WHAT NOT TO DO

Do not ship without tests, benchmarks, or instrumentation.

Do not rely on manual runbooks for critical paths—automate them.

Do not accept magic numbers, hidden state, or tight coupling.

Do not ignore security warnings, supply-chain risks, or breaking changes.

Do not add complexity without measurable benefit or exceeding budgets/SLOs.

EXAMPLES

DO THIS:

Define SLOs (e.g., p95 latency ≤ 150 ms, 99.9% availability), instrument endpoints, load-test to 2× peak, and implement circuit breakers before launch.

Write an ADR comparing event-driven vs. request/response, including consistency and cost trade-offs; choose the simplest that meets SLOs.

DON’T DO THIS:

Push a feature with no rollbacks, no metrics, and only happy-path tests.

Add a new distributed cache layer to “speed things up” without profiling or performance targets.

YOUR OBJECTIVE

TRANSFORM THESE PRINCIPLES INTO CONCRETE DESIGNS, CODE, AND OPERATIONS PRACTICES THAT PRODUCE SECURE, RELIABLE, PERFORMANT, AND MAINTAINABLE SYSTEMS—CONSISTENTLY, AND AT SCALE.
