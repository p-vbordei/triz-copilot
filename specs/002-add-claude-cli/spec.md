# Feature Specification: Claude CLI Integration for TRIZ Co-Pilot

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-claude-cli`  
**Created**: 2025-01-11  
**Status**: Draft

## üìã Summary

Enable the TRIZ Engineering Co-Pilot to work seamlessly with Claude CLI (claude.ai/code) in addition to the existing Gemini CLI integration, allowing users to access systematic innovation capabilities through either AI assistant platform.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Currently, the TRIZ Co-Pilot only supports Google Gemini CLI through MCP server integration. Users who prefer or have access to Claude CLI cannot use the TRIZ systematic innovation tools, limiting the reach and utility of the system. Organizations may have different AI tool preferences or licenses, and supporting multiple platforms increases adoption potential.

## üë• User Scenarios & Testing

### Scenario 1: Claude CLI User Accesses TRIZ Workflow
**Given**: A user has Claude CLI installed and configured  
**When**: They invoke `/triz-workflow` command in Claude  
**Then**: The guided TRIZ workflow starts, maintaining session state across interactions

### Scenario 2: Seamless Tool Switching
**Given**: A user has both Claude CLI and Gemini CLI available  
**When**: They start a TRIZ session in Claude and later continue in Gemini  
**Then**: The session state persists and the workflow continues from the last step

### Scenario 3: Direct Tool Access in Claude
**Given**: An experienced TRIZ user working in Claude CLI  
**When**: They use `/triz-tool get-principle 15` command  
**Then**: They receive the full Principle 15 (Dynamics) description with examples

### Scenario 4: Autonomous Problem Solving
**Given**: A user describes an engineering problem in Claude CLI  
**When**: They invoke `/triz-solve "reduce weight while maintaining strength"`  
**Then**: Claude analyzes the problem and provides a structured TRIZ solution report

### Scenario 5: Command Discovery
**Given**: A new user opens Claude CLI with TRIZ Co-Pilot  
**When**: They type `/triz` or look for available commands  
**Then**: They see all three TRIZ command options with clear descriptions

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

- [ ] Output must include: Problem Summary, Contradictions, Top Principles, and 3-5 Solution Concepts
- [ ] Response time must be under 10 seconds for complete analysis

### Direct Tool Mode
- [ ] `/triz-tool get-principle [1-40]` must return principle details from knowledge base
- [ ] `/triz-tool contradiction-matrix --improving [1-39] --worsening [1-39]` must return relevant principles
- [ ] `/triz-tool brainstorm --principle [1-40] --context "[problem]"` must generate contextual ideas
- [ ] Invalid parameters must return helpful error messages with valid ranges

### Session Management
- [ ] Sessions started in Claude must have unique identifiers
- [ ] Session data must be stored in the same format as Gemini sessions
- [ ] Users must be able to resume interrupted sessions with session ID
- [ ] Session timeout must be configurable (default: 24 hours)

### Knowledge Base Access
- [ ] Claude must access the same TRIZ principles database (40 principles)
- [ ] Contradiction matrix (39x39) must be available for lookups
- [ ] Materials database must be searchable when applicable
- [ ] All examples and sub-principles must be retrievable

### Response Formatting
- [ ] Responses must use consistent markdown formatting
- [ ] Numbered lists for principles and solutions
- [ ] Bold headers for sections
- [ ] Code blocks for technical examples when relevant
- [ ] Tables for contradiction matrix results

### Error Handling
- [ ] Missing dependencies must be detected and reported clearly
- [ ] Database connection failures must have fallback to file-based data
- [ ] Invalid commands must suggest closest valid command
- [ ] Network timeouts must not crash the session

### Platform Compatibility
- [ ] Must coexist with Gemini CLI integration without conflicts
- [ ] Shared session storage must be accessible from both platforms
- [ ] Configuration must allow enabling/disabling each integration independently
- [ ] Must support Claude CLI on macOS, Windows, and Linux
