# Check Ollama
ollama list

# Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Pull model if missing
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

python3 -c "
from src.triz_tools.services.vector_service import get_vector_service
vs = get_vector_service()
info = vs.get_collection_info('triz_documents')
print(f'Books ingested: {info[\"points_count\"] if info else 0} chunks')
"
```

### uv Command Not Found
